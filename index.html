    <h1>Traditional Colombian starter dishes</h1>
     <p>Colombian food is very diverse. It offers dishes that have been handed down from generation to generation,
        influenced by not only indigenous Colombian culture, but Spanish, African and Arab nuances as well. 
        Over the years, the concoction of flavours from different influences has given Colombian cuisine its complex
        flavour profile.</p>
