    <h1>Traditional Colombian Recipes</h1>
     <p>Colombian food is very diverse. It offers dishes that have been handed down from generation to generation,
        influenced by not only indigenous Colombian culture, but Spanish, African and Arab nuances as well. 
        Over the years, the concoction of flavours from different influences has given Colombian cuisine its complex
        flavour profile.</p>

  <p>Author: <b>Javier Romero</b></p>
    <p>The first reference to this product was made in 1539, it is evidence that its origin was from the natives of the 
        new world since in the writings of the time there were descriptions on a thick cake called arepas. 
        Today this food is very common in Venezuela and Colombia being a shared heritage of our ancestors, 
        adapted to the local tastes of each. In Colombia each region has its own way of preparing 
        arepas, grilled, roasted, fried or baked. May be sweet or salty, stuffed or unfilled.</p>
        <p><b>Time: 45 minutes - Difficulty: Easy - 219Kal</b></p>
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>225 g pre-cooked white maize flour</li>
        <li>360 ml of wate</li>
        <li>40 g of butter</li>
        <li>150 g grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Mix the water with the flour</h3>
            <p>We begin by putting in a large bowl the warm water. Then we add the flour gradually while we mix. 
            As we put the flour, it will be made into a dough.</p>
            </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add salt and butter</h3>
            <p>Once we have mixed all the flour, add the salt, integrate it, and then melted butter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add the cheese</h3>
            <p>After adding the butter to the dough, add the grated mozzarella cheese and mix it with the rest of the dough.
                 Then I recommend taking it to a flat surface and continue kneading it about 5 minutes more. 
                 If you see that it sticks to the hands in excess, you have to put a little more flour until this does not happen.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Start shaping the arepas</h3>
            <p>With the dough ready, itâ€™s time to shape  the arepas. 
                We take a dumpling and crush it into a disc shape. Then we gather the formed cracks on edges.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the arepas</h3>
            <p>When we have several arepas formed, we put a frying pan to the fire with a splash of olive oil well extended by 
            the bottom. When it is hot, place the arepas and start cooking.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Grill the arepas</h3>
            <p>We wait for the arepas to brown on both sides. This is going to take a few minutes, at least 7 on each side.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
