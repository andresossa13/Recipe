      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>225 g pre-cooked white maize flour</li>
        <li>360 ml of wate</li>
        <li>40 g of butter</li>
        <li>150 g grated mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Olive Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Mix the water with the flour</h3>
            <p>We begin by putting in a large bowl the warm water. Then we add the flour gradually while we mix. 
            As we put the flour, it will be made into a dough.</p>
            </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add salt and butter</h3>
            <p>Once we have mixed all the flour, add the salt, integrate it, and then melted butter.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Add the cheese</h3>
            <p>After adding the butter to the dough, add the grated mozzarella cheese and mix it with the rest of the dough.
                 Then I recommend taking it to a flat surface and continue kneading it about 5 minutes more. 
                 If you see that it sticks to the hands in excess, you have to put a little more flour until this does not happen.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Start shaping the arepas</h3>
            <p>With the dough ready, itâ€™s time to shape  the arepas. 
                We take a dumpling and crush it into a disc shape. Then we gather the formed cracks on edges.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Cook the arepas</h3>
            <p>When we have several arepas formed, we put a frying pan to the fire with a splash of olive oil well extended by 
            the bottom. When it is hot, place the arepas and start cooking.</p>
        </li>
        <li> 
            <h3>Grill the arepas</h3>
            <p>We wait for the arepas to brown on both sides. This is going to take a few minutes, at least 7 on each side.</p>
        </li>
    </ol>
