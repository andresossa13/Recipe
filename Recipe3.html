                    <p>The Colombian hogao is a salty salsa and constitutes the basis of many of the typical foods of this country. 
                       It is made from tomato and onion long and white, and is widely used as a sofrito for many Colombian recipes, 
                       also as a sauce and dressing of some entrees or appetizers, adding a little cumin, oregano or achiote, 
                       this depends on the person or house in which they are made.</p>
